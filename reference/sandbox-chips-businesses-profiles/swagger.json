This in essence means that even if the API to the provider returned for example a 'not found' result, the request is still chargable on the marketplace layer.\n\nThe *providerCode* will only be present if the API was routed to the API Provider.\n\n## Marketplace Codes\n\n| Code | Description |\n|------|---------------|\n| 200 | Successfully serviced and charged. |\n| 250 | Successfully serviced with no charge. |\n| 401 | Unauthorized.  |\n| 404 | Not Found. |\n| 450 | Application Not Found. |\n| 451 | Organization Not Found. |\n| 500 | Internal Server Error. | \n\n\n\n",

The purpose is to inform the requester of status details above and beyond the HTTP status code.\n\nNote that it is possible to have a success indicator on the marketplace layer, but have a unsuccessful indication on the *providerCode*. This in essence means that even if the API to the provider returned for example a 'not found' result, the request is still chargable on the marketplace layer.\n\nThe *providerCode* will only be present if the API was routed to the API Provider.\n\n## Marketplace Codes\n\n| Code | Description |\n|------|---------------|\n| 200 | Successfully serviced and charged. |\n| 250 | Successfully serviced with no charge. |\n| 401 | Unauthorized.  |\n| 404 | Not Found. |\n| 450 | Application Not Found. |\n| 451 | Organization Not Found. |\n| 500 | Internal Server Error. | \n\n\n\n",
